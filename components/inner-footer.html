Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p><p>Copyright Â© 2017-2020, The Apache Software Foundation Apache ECharts, ECharts, Apache, the Apache feather, and the Apache ECharts project logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation.</p></div><div id="footer-icon-panel" class="col-md-4"><a href="https://www.apache.org"><img src="https://echarts.apache.org/undefined/images/asf_logo.svg?_v_=20200710_1" class="footer-apache-logo"/></a></div></div></div></footer>
